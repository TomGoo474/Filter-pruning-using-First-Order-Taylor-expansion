# Filter-pruning-using-First-Order-Taylor-expansion
### Item Abstract üòÄ
This project presents a filter pruning method using First-Order Taylor expansion. It provides an effective way to reduce the number of parameters in deep learning models, thereby improving inference speed and memory efficiency.

### Key Features üòõ
1. Proposes a filter pruning method based on First-Order Taylor expansion, which effectively identifies and prunes redundant filters.
2. The method significantly reduces the number of model parameters without a substantial drop in model performance.
3. Provides corresponding MATLAB code implementation, making it easy to apply to practical deep learning model optimization.
